A core design principle of the library is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state.\n",

I use my standard toolkit of basic mechanistic interpretability techniques to try interpreting a real circuit in GPT-2 small.

        "\n",
        "A good starting point is thinking though whether a tiny model could do this, eg a <a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html\">1L Attn-Only model</a>. I'm pretty sure the answer is no! Attention is really good at the primitive operations of looking nearby, or copying information. I can believe a tiny model could figure out that at `to` it should look for names and predict that those names came next (eg the skip trigram \" John...to -> John\"). But it's much harder to tell how <i>many</i> of each previous name there are - attending 0.3 to each copy of John will look exactly the same as attending 0.6 to a single John token. So this will be pretty hard to figure out on the \" to\" token!\n",
        "\n",
        "The natural place to break this symmetry is on the second \" John\" token - telling whether there is an earlier copy of the <i>current</i> token should be a much easier task. So I might expect there to be a head which detects duplicate tokens on the second \" John\" token, and then another head which moves that information from the second \" John\" token to the \" to\" token.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model then needs to learn to predict \" Mary\" and <i>not</i> \" John\". I can see two natural ways to do this:\n",
        "1. Detect all preceding names and move this information to \" to\" and then delete the any name corresponding to the duplicate token feature. This feels easier done with a non-linearity, since precisely cancelling out vectors is hard, so I'd imagine an MLP layer deletes the \" John\" direction of the residual stream\n",
        "2. Have a head which attends to all previous names, but where the duplicate token features <i>inhibit</i> it from attending to specific names. So this only attends to Mary. And then the output of this head maps to the logits.  \n",
        "\n",
        "(Spoiler: It's the second one).\n",
        "\n",
        "<h3>Experiment Ideas</h3>\n",
        "\n",
        "A test that could distinguish these two is to look at which components of the model add directly to the logits - if it's mostly attention heads which attend to \" Mary\" and to neither \" John\" it's probably hypothesis 2, if it's mostly MLPs it's probably hypothesis 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "And we should be able to identify duplicate token heads by finding ones which attend from \" John\" to \" John\", and whose outputs are then moved to the \" to\" token by V-Composition with another head (Spoiler: It's more complicated than that!)\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that all of the above reasoning is very simplistic and could easily break in a real model! There'll be significant parts of the model that figure out whether to use this circuit at all (we don't want to inhibit duplicated names when, eg, figuring out what goes at the start of the <i>next</i> sentence), and may be parts towards the end of the model that do \"post-processing\" just before the final output.

        "Further, the easiest part of the model to understand is the output - this is what the model is trained to optimize, and so it can always be directly interpreted! Often the right approach to reverse engineering a circuit is to start at the end, understand how the model produces the right answer, and to then work backwards. The main technique used to do this is called **direct logit attribution**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Background:** The central object of a transformer is the **residual stream**. This is the sum of the outputs of each layer and of the original token and positional embedding. Importantly, this means that any linear function of the residual stream can be perfectly decomposed into the contribution of each layer of the transformer. Further, each attention layer's output can be broken down into the sum of the output of each head (See [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) for details), and each MLP layer's output can be broken down into the sum of the output of each neuron (and a bias term for each layer).\n",
        "\n",
        "The logits of a model are `logits=Unembed(LayerNorm(final_residual_stream))`. The Unembed is a linear map, and LayerNorm is approximately a linear map, so we can decompose the logits into the sum of the contributions of each component, and look at which components contribute the most to the logit of the correct token! This is called **direct logit attribution**. Here we look at the direct attribution to the logit difference!\n",

        "<details> <summary>(*) <b>Background and motivation of the logit difference</b></summary>\n",
        "\n",
        "Logit difference is actually a *really* nice and elegant metric and is a particularly nice aspect of the setup of Indirect Object Identification. In general, there are two natural ways to interpret the model's outputs: the output logits, or the output log probabilities (or probabilities).\n",
        "\n",
        "The logits are much nicer and easier to understand, as noted above. However, the model is trained to optimize the cross-entropy loss (the average of log probability of the correct token). This means it does not directly optimize the logits, and indeed if the model adds an arbitrary constant to every logit, the log probabilities are unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "But `log_probs == logits.log_softmax(dim=-1) == logits - logsumexp(logits)`, and so `log_probs(\" Mary\") - log_probs(\" John\") = logits(\" Mary\") - logits(\" John\")` - the ability to add an arbitrary constant cancels out!\n",
        "\n",
        "Further, the metric helps us isolate the precise capability we care about - figuring out *which* name is the Indirect Object. There are many other components of the task - deciding whether to return an article (the) or pronoun (her) or name, realising that the sentence wants a person next at all, etc. By taking the logit difference we control for all of that.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our metric is further refined, because each prompt is repeated twice, for each possible indirect object. This controls for irrelevant behaviour such as the model learning that John is a more frequent token than Mary (this actually happens! The final layernorm bias increases the John logit by 1 relative to the Mary logit)\n",

        "\n",
        "LayerNorm is an analogous normalization technique to BatchNorm (that's friendlier to massive parallelization) that transformers use. Every time a transformer layer reads information from the residual stream, it applies a LayerNorm to normalize the vector at each position (translating to set the mean to 0 and scaling to set the variance to 1) and then applying a learned vector of weights and biases to scale and translate the normalized vector. This is *almost* a linear map, apart from the scaling step, because that divides by the norm of the vector and the norm is not a linear function. (The `fold_ln` flag when loading a model factors out all the linear parts).\n",
        "\n",
        "But if we fixed the scale factor, the LayerNorm would be fully linear. And the scale of the residual stream is a global property that's a function of *all* components of the stream, while in practice there is normally just a few directions relevant to any particular component, so in practice this is an acceptable approximation. So when doing direct logit attribution we use the `apply_ln` flag on the `cache` to apply the global layernorm scaling factor to each constant. See [my clean GPT-2 implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Clean_Transformer_Implementation) for more on LayerNorm.\n",

It also really surprising that there are *negative* heads - eg L10H7 makes the incorrect logit 7x *more* likely. I'm not sure what's going on there, though the paper discusses some possibilities."

Especially later on in the model, there may be components in the residual stream that are nothing to do with the input token! Eg the period at the end of a sentence may contain summary information for that sentence, and the head may solely move that, rather than caring about whether it ends in \".\", \"!\" or \"?\"\n",

To use it in practice with TransformerLens, see [this demonstration instead](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/demos/Activation_Patching_in_TL_Demo.ipynb)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The obvious limitation to the techniques used above is that they only look at the very end of the circuit - the parts that directly affect the logits. Clearly this is not sufficient to understand the circuit! We want to understand how things compose together to produce this final output, and ideally to produce an end-to-end circuit fully explaining this behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "The technique we'll use to investigate this is called **activation patching**. This was first introduced in [David Bau and Kevin Meng's excellent ROME paper](https://rome.baulab.info/), there called causal tracing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The setup of activation patching is to take two runs of the model on two different inputs, the clean run and the corrupted run. The clean run outputs the correct answer and the corrupted run does not. The key idea is that we give the model the corrupted input, but then **intervene** on a specific activation and **patch** in the corresponding activation from the clean run (ie replace the corrupted activation with the clean activation), and then continue the run. And we then measure how much the output has updated towards the correct answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can then iterate over many possible activations and look at how much they affect the corrupted run. If patching in an activation significantly increases the probability of the correct answer, this allows us to *localise* which activations matter.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ability to localise is a key move in mechanistic interpretability - if the computation is diffuse and spread across the entire model, it is likely much harder to form a clean mechanistic story for what's going on. But if we can identify precisely which parts of the model matter, we can then zoom in and determine what they represent and how they connect up with each other, and ultimately reverse engineer the underlying circuit that they represent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an animation from the ROME paper demonstrating this technique (they studied factual recall, and use stars to represent corruption applied to the subject of the sentence, but the same principles apply):\n",

These prompts are identical except for the name of the indirect object, and so patching is a causal intervention which will allow us to understand precisely which parts of the network are identifying the indirect object.\n",
        "\n",
        "One natural thing to patch in is the residual stream at a specific layer and specific position. For example, the model is likely initially doing some processing on the second subject token to realise that it's a duplicate, but then uses attention to move that information to the \" to\" token. So patching in the residual stream at the \" to\" token will likely matter a lot in later layers but not at all in early layers.\n",

By carefully setting up the counterfactual, that <i>only</i> differs in the second subject, we avoid detecting the parts of the model doing irrelevant computation like detecting that the indirect object task is relevant at all or that it should be outputting a name rather than an article or pronoun. Or even context like that John and Mary are names at all.\n",

        "In the ROME paper they take a different tack. Rather than carefully setting up counterfactuals between two different but related inputs, they **corrupt** the clean input by adding Gaussian noise to the token embedding for the subject. This is in some ways much lower effort (you don't need to set up a similar but different prompt) but can also introduce some issues, such as ways this noise might break things. In practice, you should take care about how you choose your counterfactuals and try out several. Try to reason beforehand about what they will and will not tell you, and compare the results between different counterfactuals.\n",

Within this frame, the first attention layer doesn't do much.\n",

An attention head consists of two semi-independent operations - calculating *where* to move information from and to (represented by the attention pattern and implemented via the QK-circuit) and calculating *what* information to move (represented by the value vectors and implemented by the OV circuit). We can disentangle which of these is important by patching in just the attention pattern *or* the value vectors. (See [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) or [my walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5gbOmHbjU) for more on this decomposition. If you're not familiar with the details of how attention is implemented, I recommend checking out [my clean transformer implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=3Pb0NYbZ900e) to see how the code works))"

        "First off, what's an induction head? An induction head is an important type of attention head that can detect and continue repeated sequences. It is the second head in a two head induction circuit, which looks for previous copies of the current token and attends to the token *after* it, and then copies that to the current position and predicts that it will come next. They're enough of a big deal that [we wrote a whole paper on them](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html).\n",

The model doesn't care about *what* token comes after the first copy of the subject, just that it's duplicated. And it already has simpler duplicate token heads. My best guess is that it just already had induction heads around and that, in addition to their main function, they *also* only activate on duplicated tokens. So it was useful to repurpose this existing machinery.\n",

        "Another fascinating anomaly is that of the **backup name mover heads**. A standard technique to apply when interpreting model internals is ablations, or knock-out. If we run the model but intervene to set a specific head to zero, what happens? If the model is robust to this intervention, then naively we can be confident that the head is not doing anything important, and conversely if the model is much worse at the task this suggests that head was important. There are several conceptual flaws with this approach, making the evidence only suggestive, eg that the average output of the head may be far from zero and so the knockout may send it far from expected activations, breaking internals on *any* task. But it's still an easy technique to apply to give some data.\n",

If we knock out one of the name movers, then there are some backup name movers in later layers that *change their behaviour* and do (some of) the job of the original name mover head. This means that naive knock-out will significantly underestimate the importance of the name movers.\n"

We focus on the final position because we want to specifically ablate the direct logit effect. When we do this, we see that naively, removing the top name mover should reduce the logit diff massively, from 3.55 to 0.57. **But actually, it only goes down to 2.99!**\n",

We can just define a hook on the z activation in the relevant attention layer (recall, z is the mixed values, and comes immediately before multiplying by the output weights $W_O$). z has a head_index axis, so we can set the component for the relevant head and for position -1 to zero, and return it. (Technically we could just edit in place without returning it, but by convention we always return an edited activation).\n",

So we can directly access the hook on the z activation with `model.blocks[layer].attn.hook_z` and call its `add_hook` method. This adds in the hook to the *global state* of the model. We can now use run_with_cache, and don't need to care about the global state, because run_with_cache internally adds a bunch of caching hooks, and then removes all hooks after the run, *including* the previously added ablation hook. This can be disabled with the reset_hooks_end flag, but here it's useful!\n",
